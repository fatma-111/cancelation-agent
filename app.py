"""
FastAPI wrapper around the LLM-tool-calling LangGraph cancellation agent.

REWRITTEN (see app.py.pre_rewrite_backup for the old version). The old
file had to reconstruct main.py's two pre-graph CLI questions and
distinguish "graph paused on wait_for_otp/selection/confirmation" from
"graph not started yet" via graph.get_state(...).next, because the old
graph had a fixed sequence of named interrupt points. None of that
exists anymore: every turn is now identical - append the user's message,
invoke the graph, return the LLM's reply - handled by main.py's
send_message(), completely unmodified from what main.py's own CLI calls.
This file is now a thin, literal HTTP wrapper with no logic of its own
beyond request/response shaping and error handling.
