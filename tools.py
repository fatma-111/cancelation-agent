"""
LangChain tools for the LLM-tool-calling Guest Booking Cancellation Agent.

REWRITTEN (see tools.py.pre_rewrite_backup for the old version). Every
tool now returns STRUCTURED DATA ONLY - no formatted sentences, no
message-template lookups, no natural language of any kind. The LLM
(driven by prompts.AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE) is solely responsible
for turning these status codes/data into user-facing replies. This is
the literal architecture change requested: tools never speak to the
user.

What did NOT change: api.py (all raw HTTP calls), config.py (client
config / base_url resolution), the timezone conversion math, the
active-booking filter, and the OTP dummy-provider mechanics. Those are
"Company APIs" / "booking logic" / "OTP logic" and were explicitly
required to stay untouched - only the OUTPUT SHAPE of the functions that
wrap them changed, from "already-formatted text" to "plain status/data".

Removed entirely (superseded by the LLM's own reasoning, since "the LLM
should decide" replaces every heuristic classifier):
  detect_message, extract_input_details, resolve_selection,
  parse_confirmation, detect_step_back, format_message,
  format_booking_card, format_booking_list, format_time_12h, format_date,
  find_matching_appointment (replaced by check_booking_status's ref-based
  re-lookup, simpler and equally safe since ref numbers are unique).

def _filter_active(items: list) -> list:
    """Phone-path-only filter, applied when looking up bookings by phone
    number so the user can choose which one to cancel.

    CHANGED (explicit user request, based on a real dashboard screenshot):
    "active"/cancellable no longer requires a scheduled future visit date.
    It now means the booking's statusName indicates it HASN'T happened
    yet - i.e. anything other than Cancelled/Completed/Arrived. This
    specifically includes "New" bookings that don't have a visit date
    set yet at all (shown as "-" in the dashboard) - those are still
    perfectly cancellable and must appear.

    Previously this required `bookingTimeFrom` to be set AND in the
    future, which silently excluded every "New" booking without a
    visit date yet - that was the actual root cause of "no booking
    found" despite a visible, cancellable "New" row in the dashboard.

    The reference-number lookup path does NOT apply this filter at all -
    that asymmetry is unchanged, carried over from the original business
    logic.

    ADDED BACK (explicit follow-up request): a booking with a scheduled
    visit date that has already passed must be excluded too, even if its
    status is still "New" (e.g. a no-show never updated in the source
    system) - it can't practically be cancelled anymore. A "New" booking
    with NO visit date set at all is still included (nothing to compare
    against - it hasn't happened by definition).

    STATUS CODES (confirmed directly from the Booking API's own
    documentation): New=1, Confirmed=2, Arrived=3, NoShow=4, Completed=5,
    Cancelled=6. Only New/Confirmed are cancellable. This now checks the
    NUMERIC `status` field as the primary, reliable mechanism (language-
    independent - no more guessing at Arabic vs English spelling), with
    the earlier string-based `statusName` matching kept only as a
    fallback for the rare item that might be missing a numeric status
    for some reason."""
