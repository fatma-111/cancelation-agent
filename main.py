Agent entrypoint / orchestration layer.

REWRITTEN (see main.py.pre_rewrite_backup for the old version). The old
functions (start_cancellation_by_reference, start_cancellation_by_phone,
resume_with_value, pending_interrupt, etc.) existed to drive a fixed
sequence of graph interrupts. There is no such fixed sequence anymore -
the LLM decides everything - so this file collapses to the one thing
that's actually still needed: append a HumanMessage to a thread's chat
history, invoke the graph, and return whatever the LLM's final message
of that turn is. That's it. This is intentionally much simpler than
before, which is a direct consequence of moving all conversation logic
into the LLM.

The CLI (`python main.py`) still behaves the same way from the user's
point of view - free-text back and forth - even though its internal
implementation necessarily changed along with the graph shape.

# Tracks, per session_id, when it last sent a message and which
# "generation" it's currently on. Two independent triggers bump the
# generation counter - which changes the actual thread_id passed to the
# graph/checkpointer, so MemorySaver treats it as a brand new, empty
# conversation:
#
#   1. General inactivity: more than SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS since the
#      last message of any kind.
#   2. Post-success inactivity: more than POST_SUCCESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
#      since a cancellation completed successfully, with no further
#      message in between. A quick follow-up question right after a
#      successful cancellation does NOT reset anything and does NOT
#      trigger the opening greeting again - it's still the same natural
#      conversation. Only silence AFTER the success, past this shorter
#      window, starts a fresh one.
#
# The caller's own session_id never changes; this is entirely internal
# bookkeeping. Consistent with MemorySaver itself, this is in-process
# only (resets on server restart too - see README).

    This is the ONLY public function this file needs now: whether it's
    the first message of a brand new conversation or a follow-up to an
    earlier question, the call is identical - the checkpointer
    (MemorySaver, preserved) already knows the full prior chat history
    for this thread_id, so client_id/channel_phone only need to be
    supplied again in case they weren't set yet (load_config is a no-op
    once templates are already cached for this thread).

    RESET BEHAVIOR: memory resets automatically in two cases -
      1. After SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS of general inactivity.
      2. After POST_SUCCESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS of no follow-up message
         following a successful cancellation specifically (below) - NOT
         immediately after success. A quick follow-up question right
         after cancelling stays in the same conversation (no repeated
         greeting); only silence past that shorter window starts fresh.
    See _config_for() for exactly how these two triggers are evaluated.
